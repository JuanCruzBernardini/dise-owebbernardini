                <p class="lead mb-0">Saul Hudson, better known as Slash, was born to an African American mother and
                    British father in London on July 23, 1965. A family friend gave him the nickname "Slash," because he
                    was constantly in motion.

                    Slash lived with his father and grandparents in Stoke-on-Trent until the age of five, when he and
                    his father joined his mother in Los Angeles. His parents divorced several years later, and Slash
                    became a "problem child." He lost interest in schoolwork and took up BMX racing. At 14, he began
                    learning to play guitar, sometimes practicing for as many as 12 hours a day. In 1981, he joined his
                    first band, Tidus Sloan, and dropped out of high school to tour.</p>

                <h1>GUNS N' ROSES: SEX DRUGS AND HARD ROCK</h1>
                <p> Slash joined or formed a series of bands. Among them was Hollywood Rose, which also included Axl
                    Rose
                    and Izzy Stradlin. The band didn't last, but in 1985 Rose and Stradlin asked Slash to join their new
                    band, Guns N' Roses. They began writing the songs that they would become known for, including "Sweet
                    Child o' Mine," "Welcome to the Jungle" and "Paradise City," and were signed by Geffen Records in
                    1986.

                    By the time Guns N' Roses released their debut album, Appetite for Destruction, in 1987, Slash and
                    other
                    members of the band had developed a drug problem. Two years later, when the band opened for the
                    Rolling
                    Stones, Axl Rose made a very public announcement that he would leave the band if the other members
                    kept
                    using heroin.
                    In 1991, the band embarked on the two-and-a-half-year Use Your Illusion tour and released the albums
                    Use
                    Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II. The albums debuted at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, on
                    the
                    Billboard 200 list, but the group was losing steam. Izzy Stradlin left the group suddenly, and their
                    next album, a compilation of punk and glam-rock covers titled The Spaghetti Incident, performed
                    poorly
                    compared to their earlier work. Slash's final show with the band was on July 17, 1993, and after a
                    period of dormancy, he announced in 1996 that he was no longer a member of the band. Although he was
                    widely rumored to have left the band because of artistic conflicts with Axl Rose, Slash's 2007
                    autobiography claims that he quit Guns N' Roses because Izzy Stradlin and Steven Adler left, because
                    Rose required band members to sign contracts that made them "hired hands" and because Rose made the
                    band
                    take the stage hours later than planned during tours.

                    Twenty years after Slash's departure from the band, in March 2016, it was announced that Guns N'
                    Roses
                    would be reuniting for a 21-city North American tour, with shows in Las Vegas, at Coachella and in
                    Mexico City scheduled as a lead up to the highly anticipated event. Guns'N Roses wen on tour early
                    in
                    2022 visiting South America and many other countries. </p>

                <p>
                    After he finished touring with Guns N' Roses, Slash formed a series of bands, including Slash's
                    Snakepit and a blues cover band called Slash's Blues Ball. In 2003, he formed Velvet Revolver, which
                    was largely praised and heralded as a successful comeback. Slash also released two solo albums, one
                    in 2008 and one in 2012 both gained success and he went on tour several times with his solo band.
