                <h3 class="text-start">The start of the journey:</h3>
                <p class="lead mb-0">Kirk Lee Hammett born November 18, 1962 is an American musician who has been
                    the lead guitarist and a contributing songwriter for heavy metal band Metallica since 1983. Before
                    joining Metallica, he formed and named the band Exodus. In 2003, Hammett was ranked 11th on Rolling
                    Stone's list of The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.</p>

                <p>
                    Hammett began showing an interest in music after listening to his brother Rick's extensive record
                    collection which included Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and UFO. He began selling his horror
                    magazines to buy music records, which led him to properly picking up the guitar at the age of
                    fifteen. Hammett's first guitar was (in his own words) a "wholly unglamorous" Montgomery Ward
                    catalog special, which was accompanied by a shoebox (with a 4-inch speaker) for an amp. After
                    purchasing a 1978 Fender Stratocaster copy, Hammett attempted to customize his sound with various
                    guitar parts, before eventually buying a 1974 Gibson Flying V.

                <h5>Exodus</h5>
                <p>Hammett's musical interests eventually drew him into the fledgling thrash metal genre. In 1979, he
                    formed the band Exodus at the age of sixteen, along with vocalist Paul Baloff, guitarist Tim
                    Agnello, bassist Geoff Andrews, and drummer Tom Hunting. Hammett named Exodus after the Leon Uris
                    novel of the same name,and played on the band's 1982 Demo and its successor Die By His Hand
                    from 1983.Exodus was an influential band in the Bay Area thrash movement.</p>

                <h1>METALLICA: KIRK'S HOME</h1>
                <p class=" text-md-start lh-1" class="fw-normal">
                In 1983, Metallica traveled to the east coast to record its debut album, Kill 'Em All. Due to lead
                guitarist Dave Mustaine's substance abuse and violent tendencies, he was fired shortly after their
                arrival, and would eventually form the band Megadeth. Hammett received a phone call from Metallica
                on April 1, and flew out to New York for an audition on April 11, the same day Mustaine was let go.
                Vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield said: "The first song we played was "Seek and Destroy", and Kirk
                pulled off this solo, and it was like ... things are going to be alright!". Hammett was instantly asked
                to join the band.
                Hammett has written a number of riffs for Metallica since Ride the Lightning (the band's second album).
                One of his riffs was used on "Enter Sandman" - which went on to become one of Metallica's most popular
                songs. It was the first track and the first single on the band's self-titled album (also known as The
                Black Album), and was ranked 399th on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.
                The bridge for "Creeping Death" was originally an Exodus riff that Hammett took with him to Metallica.

                In 1986, during the band's European leg of their tour to support Master of Puppets, the group had a
                dispute over sleeping arrangements on their tour bus. The outcome of the dispute was decided by a card
                draw, which Cliff Burton won by picking the Ace of Spades. Once the draw was completed, Burton looked at
                Hammett and said "I want your bunk", to which Hammett complied, saying that he might be able to sleep
                better in the front of the bus anyway. In the early hours of the following morning, Metallica's tour bus
                slid off the road and overturned in Sweden. Burton was thrown through the window of the bus, which fell
                on top of Burton and subsequently killed him. Hammett has stated in an interview that he once
                thought that it easily could have been him who was killed instead, since Burton was sleeping in what was
                considered to be Hammett's bunk. In Kirk's own words: "You know to this day I just think, it could have
                been me or it couldn't have been me but ... it's never left me to this day."

                Between the end of touring and promoting the Black Album and the start of touring in promotion of
                Load, he studied at San Francisco State University, focusing on film and Asian arts. Hammett went
                through a "blues period" around this time - which had some influence on Metallica's Load and Reload
                albums. He also began listening to a lot of jazz music. Hammett described this period of his life as
                "great education", because he was able to discover where all of his own rock influences had gotten their
                own guitar licks. However, even though jazz music had a profound effect on his improvisation skills
                and solos, Hammett felt that he was delving too deep into the genre. Since Death Magnetic, Hammett has
                gone back to being "primarily" a metal guitarist, but some of his influences of jazz and blues music
                still remain. </p>

                <p class="text-start">
                    Hammett went to record 8 more albums with metallica, and even more including the live ones, and still performs as they were on tour early this year.
