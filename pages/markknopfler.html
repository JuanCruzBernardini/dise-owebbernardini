                <h1 class="flip-2-hor-top-1 fw-bolder text-decoration-underline">THE STORY OF MARK KNOPFLER</h1>
                <p class="lead mb-0">Mark Freuder Knopfler was born in Glasgow, Scotland on August 12, 1949. His father,
                    a Hungarian émigré, worked as an architect, while his mother, of English heritage, was a
                    schoolteacher. The Knopfler family moved to England when Mark was seven, settling in
                    Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, and he developed a passion for music while spending time with his uncle; as he
                    told journalist Dan Forte, "I heard my Uncle Kingsley playing boogie-woogie on the piano when I was
                    about eight or nine, and I thought that those three chords were the most magnificent things in the
                    world -- still do." A few years later, Knopfler began learning to play guitar, first on an
                    inexpensive Hofner model before moving up to a Fender electric his father bought for him.</p>

                <h1>DIRE STRAITS: A DIRE CALL FOR SUCCESS</h1>
                <p> Dire Straits found a champion in BBC disc jockey Charlie Gillett, who began playing their demo on
                    his
                    show, attracting the attention of manager Ed Bicknell and Polygram A&R man John Stainze. Bicknell
                    took
                    Dire Straits under his wing and Stainze signed the group to Polygram's progressive and hard rock
                    subsidiary Vertigo Records; Warner Bros. picked up the band for U.S. distribution. Dire Straits'
                    self-titled debut album was released in the fall of 1978, and the song "Sultans of Swing" became a
                    surprise hit single in both America and the U.K.; the album followed it into the charts, as the
                    group's
                    clean, expert playing, and Knopfler's deft lead guitars, Dylanesque vocals, and evocative songs won
                    the
                    band airplay on pop and classic rock playlists. It was the first of a long string of successes for
                    Dire
                    Straits, and while the lineup would shift frequently over the group's lifespan -- Mark Knopfler and
                    John
                    Illsley would prove to be the group's only constants -- between 1978 and 1995 the group was a top
                    concert draw and a frequent presence on radio and record charts; their landmark 1985 album Brothers
                    in
                    Arms sold over nine million copies in the United States alone, and was the top-selling CD of the
                    '80s in
                    the U.K.
                    Dire Straits count with a very succesfull repertoire with 7 studio albums and 2 live albums
                    releasing the last one in 1995, before Knopfler went full solo </p>
                <h1>Solo Career:</h1>
                <p>Knopfler began expanding his creative boundaries. In 1979, he was invited to play lead guitar on Bob
                    Dylan's album Slow Train Coming, and in 1983, he produced Dylan's Infidels, as well as leading the
                    backing band. In addition to producing much of Dire Straits' catalog, Knopfler was behind the
                    controls for albums by Aztec Camera, Randy Newman, and Willy DeVille. Knopfler lent his talents as a
                    session guitarist to an impressive and diverse range of artists, including Van Morrison, Phil
                    Lynott, Steely Dan, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Cliff Richard, and Scott Walker. He also penned the song
                    "Private Dancer" for Tina Turner's triumphant comeback album of the same name, and found his songs
                    being covered by the Shadows, whose legendary guitarist Hank Marvin was one of Knopfler's first
                    inspirations. In 1983, Knopfler added "film composer" to his résumé when he wrote the score for the
                    Scottish comedy Local Hero; Knopfler's music was cited in many of the film's rave reviews, and he
                    would later score the films Cal, The Princess Bride, Last Exit to Brooklyn, and Wag the Dog, among
                    others. And when Weird Al Yankovic asked Knopfler's permission to record a parody of Dire Straits'
                    "Money for Nothing" for the soundtrack to his film UHF, Knopfler agreed under one condition -- that
                    he be allowed to re-create his guitar parts for Yankovic's version. Weird Al happily acceded to
                    Knopfler's request.
                    After Knopfler made guest appearances on several albums by another of his heroes, Nashville icon
                    Chet Atkins, the two cut a collaborative project in 1990, called Neck & Neck, which was the first
                    non-soundtrack album Knopfler released under his own name. Knopfler also showed off his love of
                    country sounds with his side project, the Notting Hillbillies, which featured Brendan Croker, Guy
                    Fletcher, and Mark's old Duolian String Pickers partner Steve Phillips. In the fall of 1992, Dire
                    Straits played their last concert, a show in Spain on tour in support of On Every Street, and in
                    1995, Knopfler quietly announced that he'd retired the band, feeling they'd become too big. Released
                    in 1996, Golden Heart became Knopfler's official solo debut, followed in 2000 by Sailing to
                    Philadelphia, which included guest appearances by Van Morrison, James Taylor, Gillian Welch, and
                    Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The newly prolific Knopfler shortly returned to the
                    studio and released The Ragpicker's Dream in the fall of 2002; a world tour was planned, but after
                    Knopfler was involved in a motorcycle accident that left him with a broken shoulder and collarbone,
                    the dates were canceled. However, he was soon feeling well enough to go back to recording, and
                    issued Shangri-La in 2004, a set recorded at the Malibu compound where the Band recorded and
                    rehearsed in the '70s.
                    As Knopfler's taste for rootsy, country-influenced sounds became a growing presence in his solo
                    work, he began working on material with singer Emmylou Harris, and their collaborative album, 2006's
                    All the Roadrunning, was recorded during sessions spread over seven years. Knopfler and Harris
                    toured together in support of the set, and a live album, Real Live Roadrunning, came out later the
                    same year. Knopfler continued to record at a steady pace, releasing Kill to Get Crimson in 2007 and
                    Get Lucky in 2009, while still finding room to contribute to albums by Sonny Landreth, Bill Wyman,
                    Diane Schuur, Bap Kennedy, and America. The year 2012 found Knopfler releasing Privateer, the first
                    double-disc studio set of his career; the album debuted at eight in the U.K. Three years later, he
                    returned with Tracker; the album debuted at three in the U.K. and 14 in the U.S. In 2016, he
                    collaborated with Evelyn Glennie on the soundtrack for Altamira. Released in November 2018,
                    Knopfler's ninth solo album, Down the Road Wherever, covered a wide range of themes and was again
                    co-produced with former Dire Straits bandmate and longtime solo-era collaborator Guy Fletcher.
                To this day Knopfler is still performing and releasing albums, still active and never getting old.</p>
