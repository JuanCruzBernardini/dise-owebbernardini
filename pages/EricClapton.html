                <p class="lead mb-0">Eric Patrick Clapton was born March 30, 1945, in Ripley, Surrey, England.Clapton
                    grew up in a very musical household. His grandmother was a skilled pianist, and his mother and uncle
                    both enjoyed listening to big-band music. As it turns out, Clapton's absent father was also a
                    talented pianist who had played in several dance bands while stationed in Surrey.By that time, 1958,
                    rock 'n' roll had exploded onto the British music scene; for his 13th birthday, Clapton asked for a
                    guitar. He received a cheap German-made Hoyer, and finding the steel-stringed guitar difficult and
                    painful to play, he soon set it aside. At the age of 16, he gained acceptance into the Kingston
                    College of Art on a one-year probation; it was there, surrounded by teenagers with musical tastes
                    similar to his own, that Clapton really took to the instrument. Clapton was especially taken with
                    the blues guitar played by musicians such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and Alexis Korner, the
                    last of whom inspired Clapton to buy his first electric guitar.
                    In 1965, Clapton joined the blues band John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, the next year recording an
                    album called The Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton, which established his reputation as one of the
                    great guitarists of the age</p>

                <h1>CREAM: YOUNG ROCK N'ROLL</h1>
                <p> After his departure from The Bluesbreakers,he teamed up with bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger
                    Baker
                    to form the rock trio Cream. Performing highly original takes on blues classics such as "Crossroads"
                    and
                    "Spoonful," as well as modern blues tracks like "Sunshine of Your Love" and "White Room," Clapton
                    pushed
                    the boundaries of blues guitar. On the strength of three well-received albums, Fresh Cream (1966),
                    Disraeli Gears (1967) and Wheels of Fire (1968), as well as extensive touring in the United States,
                    Cream achieved international superstar status. Yet they, too, broke up after two final concerts at
                    London's Royal Albert Hall, citing clashing egos as the cause.</p>
                <h1>Othe Groups and Solo Career.</h1>
                <p>After the breakup of Cream, Clapton formed yet another band, Blind Faith, but the group broke up
                    after only one album and a disastrous American tour. Then, in 1970, he formed Derek and the Dominos,
                    and went on to compose and record one of the seminal albums of rock history, Layla and Other
                    Assorted Love Songs. A concept album about unrequited love, Clapton wrote Layla to express his
                    desperate affection for Pattie Boyd, the wife of the Beatles' George Harrison. The album was
                    critically acclaimed but a commercial failure, and in its aftermath a depressed and lonely Clapton
                    deteriorated into three years of heroin addiction.
                    Clapton finally kicked his drug habit and reemerged onto the music scene in 1973 with two concerts
                    at London's Rainbow Theater organized by his friend Pete Townshend of The Who. Later that year he
                    released 461 Ocean Boulevard, featuring one his most popular singles, a cover of Bob Marley's "I
                    Shot the Sheriff." The album marked the beginning of a remarkably prolific solo career during which
                    Clapton produced notable album after notable album. Highlights include No Reason to Cry (1976),
                    featuring "Hello Old Friend"; Slowhand (1977), featuring "Cocaine" and "Wonderful Tonight"; and
                    Behind the Sun (1985), featuring "She's Waiting" and "Forever Man."
                From 1985 onwards he recorded 25 more albums, and still going, sealing his legendary legacy as a guitar hero.</p>
