                <p class="lead mb-0">Darrell Lance Abbott, also known as "Diamond" Darrell or "Dimebag" Darrell (August
                    20, 1966 - December 8, 2004) was an American guitarist. Best known as a founding member of the heavy
                    metal bands Pantera and Damageplan, he also performed in the country music band Rebel Meets Rebel.
                    Abbott frequently appeared in guitar magazines and in readers' polls, where he was often included in
                    the top ten metal guitarist spots. In addition, he wrote a long-running Guitar World magazine
                    column, which has been compiled in the book Riffer Madness. Remembered for his amiable nature and
                    rapport with fans, critic Greg Prato describes Abbott as "one of the most influential stylists in
                    modern metal." On December 8, 2004, Abbott was murdered onstage during a Damageplan performance at
                    the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, US..</p>

                <h1>PANTERA: THRASHING THE 90s</h1>
                <p> Darrell formed Pantera in 1981 with his brother Vinnie Paul on drums. The band began in a glam metal
                    style, but by the late '80s showed a greater influence from thrash metal acts such as Slayer,
                    Exodus,
                    Megadeth, Exhorder and Metallica, as well as traditional metal bands such as Black Sabbath and Judas
                    Priest. Pantera subsequently became a key formulator of the post-thrash subgenre of groove metal. It
                    would not be until nine years after forming that Pantera saw its first piece of commercial success
                    in
                    its 1990 major label debut, Cowboys From Hell. Pantera's "groove" style came to fruition in its
                    breakthrough album Vulgar Display of Power, released on February 25, 1992, which saw the replacement
                    of
                    the power metal falsetto vocals with a hardcore-influenced shouted delivery and heavier guitar
                    sound. In
                    1992, Abbott dropped the nickname "Diamond Darrell" and assumed the nickname "Dimebag Darrell".
                    Pantera
                    began to suffer from mounting tensions between band members in the mid-1990s, largely due to Phil
                    Anselmo's rampant drug abuse; in 2003, the group broke up. Anselmo left the band for other projects,
                    such as Superjoint Ritual and Down. </p>
                <h1>Damageplan</h1>
                <p>After a year of the Pantera breakup brothers Vinnie and "Dimebag" formed Damageplan, a Heavy metal
                    band which also used the Pantera-style groove metal sound. The Abbott brothers recruited former
                    Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals, and Bob Zilla on bass. Damageplan released its debut album
                    New Found Power in the United States on February 10, 2004, which debuted at number 38 on the
                    Billboard 200, selling 44,676 copies in its first week. When writing music for the new group,
                    "Dimebag" said that "we wanted to stretch out and expand our capabilities to their fullest."</p>
                <h1>Columbus Ohio 2004:</h1>
                <p>On December 8, 2004, while performing with Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus, Ohio, Abbott
                    was shot onstage by a paranoid schizophrenic former US Marine named Nathan Gale. Abbott was shot
                    three times in the head, killing him instantly. Three others were killed in the shooting:
                    concert-goer Nathan Bray, age 23, of Columbus; Alrosa Villa roadie Erin Halk, age 29, of northwest
                    Columbus; and Damageplan security chief Jeff "Mayhem" Thompson, aged 40, of Texas. Damageplan's drum
                    technician, John "Kat" Brooks, and tour manager, Chris Paluska, were injured in the rampage. Gale
                    fired a total of fifteen shots, taking the time to reload once, and remaining silent throughout the
                    shooting. When security staff tried to stop him, Gale fired at them, wounding Paluska, and killing
                    Halk, who had attempted to stop the gunman with a beer bottle as a weapon.

                    Thompson fought with Gale for a short time, stopping him from killing Vinnie Paul Abbott and John
                    Graham, as well as knocking off Gale's glasses, before being fatally wounded by Gale. Audience
                    member Nathan Bray, who jumped onstage to try to give CPR to Dimebag and Thompson, stood up and took
                    a single step towards Gale before being shot once in the chest. Brooks was scuffling with Gale
                    onstage but was overpowered and taken hostage in a headlock position. Brooks was shot several times
                    (once in the right hand, his right leg, and his right side) while attempting to get the gun away
                    from Gale. Five officers came in the front entrance led by officer Rick Crum, and moved toward the
                    stage. Officer James D. Niggemeyer came in through the back door, behind the stage. Gale only saw
                    the officers in front of the stage; he never saw Officer Niggemeyer. When the hostage moved his
                    head, Officer Niggemeyer killed Gale by shooting him in the face with a police-issued Remington 870
                    shotgun. Gale was found to have 35 rounds of ammunition remaining. Officer Niggemeyer's shot hit
                    Gale with 8 out of 9 pellets from the shotgun shell. During the rampage, nurse and audience member
                    Mindy Reece, 28, went to the aid of Abbott. She and another fan administered CPR until paramedics
                    arrived, but were unable to save him.Dimebag was buried in a Kiss casket with the Eddie Van Halen
                    guitar "bumblebee", he had a lot of tributes in many songs of different bands and is greatly missed
                    to this day, but his legacy lives on, and is remembered as one of the greatest to ever do it.</p>
